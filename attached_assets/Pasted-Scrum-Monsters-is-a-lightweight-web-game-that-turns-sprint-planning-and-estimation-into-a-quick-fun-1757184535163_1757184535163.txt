Scrum Monsters is a lightweight web game that turns sprint planning and estimation into a quick, fun ritual. Your team assigns story points while battling cheeky pixel bosses like the Bug Hydra, Scope Creep Beast, and Technical Debt Golem. It plays in a browser, takes seconds to start, and keeps ceremonies lively without getting in the way of real work.
