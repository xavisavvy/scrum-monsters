About You and Your Vision

Name and title
Preston Farr, Technical Manager of Software Engineering

Background
Native mobile and full stack web developer with a strong UX research and design background. I lead engineering teams, ship products, and facilitate agile ceremonies. Based in Clearfield, Utah. I built Scrum Monsters after years of seeing planning poker lose energy and focus.

Planning and estimation can feel dry, especially remote. Scrum Monsters keeps ceremonies short, engaging, and memorable while still producing reliable story points.

Technical expertise
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind
Backend: Node.js, Express, REST and WebSocket patterns
Platforms: Replit for build and deploy, Vercel or Netlify friendly
Methods: Agile and Scrum facilitation, UX research, rapid prototyping

Contributors and Team

Who built it
Primary author: Preston Farr. Core design, code, and art direction.

AI and dev tools used
ChatGPT for brainstorming, copy, and code reviews. Replit for instant environments and deployments. Standard web tooling for build and lint.

Open source

Two short blurbs you can drop anywhere

Neutral elevator pitch
Scrum Monsters is a lightweight web game that turns sprint planning into a focused, engaging ritual. Teams estimate in seconds, stay present, and walk away with clear story points.

Opinionated elevator pitch
Planning poker should not feel like a slog. Scrum Monsters lets your team slay scope creep, bugs, and technical debt while you estimate. Fast, funny, accurate.
