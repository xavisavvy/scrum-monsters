Opinionated recommendation

Code license: AGPL-3.0-or-later for the core repo. It forces hosted forks to share changes if they run your game as a service, which protects you from a SaaS clone while still being OSI-approved open source. 
spdx.org

Alternative if you want maximum corporate adoption and don’t mind commercial reuse: Apache-2.0. It’s permissive and widely used. 
apache.org
Open Source Initiative

Art & brand license: Put all pixel art, logos, sounds, and fonts under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 so people can share but not sell or remix your artwork. That keeps your IP special for paid packs. 
Creative Commons
+1

Paid features: Ship Slack/Jira/Trello integrations, trainer slide decks, and Boss Packs under a simple commercial EULA in a /commercial folder. If a company needs closed-source embedding, offer a dual license on request.

Trademarks: Keep “Scrum Monsters” name and logo as your trademark in TRADEMARKS.md.

Contributions: Use a DCO or lightweight CLA and a CONTRIBUTING.md so you can relicense commercial bits later if needed.

Other viable paths (unopinionated)

MIT or Apache-2.0 for everything
Pros: easiest adoption. Cons: someone can resell or host it with your art; you’ll need to rely on brand + speed, not license, to compete.

MPL-2.0
Middle-ground copyleft. File-level reciprocity but fewer obligations than AGPL. Good for library-like cores.

Source-available (not OSS): BSL 1.1, Polyform Noncommercial, or Commons Clause additions if you want strict commercial control without calling it open source. Pros: strong protection. Cons: not OSI-approved, less community goodwill.
