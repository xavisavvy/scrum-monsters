# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Focused estimation that doesn't bore people. Voting should be distraction-free, but waiting for others should be fun.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-01 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Domain State Types)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Clean slate on Lobby type — Proper domain separation requires redesigning the core type (Pending)
- Fine-grained events — Real-time game best practice, send only what changed (Pending)
- Three domains (Session/Estimation/Combat) — Natural boundaries based on concerns (Pending)
- Estimation before battle entry — Keep voting focused, combat as waiting entertainment (Pending)
- Players in mixed states — Voters fight while non-voters estimate (Pending)

**From Plan 01-01:**
- Map types for runtime state — Use Map<string, T> for player collections, convert to Record for serialization later
- ID-based references — Domain states reference other domains by ID only to maintain isolation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase (unrelated to domain types) — Should be addressed in future maintenance task
